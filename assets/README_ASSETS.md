# Project assets

This folder holds the repository visuals (cover and screenshots) used in the README. Suggestions:

- cover.png — a 1600x900 hero image with a dark background and a subtle grid; title and subtitle centered.
- dashboard.png — screenshot of the Overview page with KPIs and charts.
- pivot.png — screenshot of Dynamic Visualization.
- tables.png — screenshot of the Tables page with filters.

Tip: Keep images optimized (< 500 KB each) to load fast on GitHub.
